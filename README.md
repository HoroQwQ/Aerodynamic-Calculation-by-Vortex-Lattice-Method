# Aerodynamic-Calculation-by-Vortex-Lattice-Method
This program uses matlab, based on vortex lattice method, to calculate the aerodynamic parameters of subsonic wings, supporting the aerodynamic calculation of rectangular wings, delta wings, and swept wings.

# An example for calculating swept-back wing
