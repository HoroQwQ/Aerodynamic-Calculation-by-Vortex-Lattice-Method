# Aerodynamic Calculation by Vortex Lattice Method
According to the lifting surface theory, the lifting force of swept wing and delta wing can be calculated at low speed and subsonic speed. This example is based on matlab, lifting surface theory and vortex lattice method to calculate the aerodynamic parameters of subsonic wings, supporting the aerodynamic calculation of rectangular, delta and swept-back wings.
